&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amine Moulay Ramdane has enhanced more JNI
Wrapper and ported it to 64 bit and to all the Delphi XE versions and
to FreePascal<span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span><a href="mailto:salvatoremeschini@interfree.it">aminer68@gmail.com</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<h2>Design Goal: </h2>

<p>
To provide a simplified object-oriented API for doing mixed 
language programming in Java and Delphi (Borland Object Pascal language) or FreePascal. 
This may provide an easier and more productive way of getting Win32 and Win64 
features in Java projects and integrating legacy code (at least for the 
Delphi or FreePascal community). 
</p>

<h2>General Description: </h2>

<p>  The accompanying files contain source code that makes it easy to
implement mixed language projects with Java and Delphi. JNI.pas is a
straight translation of the jni.h header file distributed with Sun's JDK.
This can be used on its own with no restriction except those applying 
to the use of the Sun JDK (not to be used flying aircraft or
operating nuclear facilities and whatnot.)</p>


<p>The files JNIWrapper.pas and JavaRuntime.pas contain the source code to
wrapper classes I have written to provide a much easier object-oriented
interface to the Java Native Interface (JNI). These classes include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>TJavaRuntime</code> is an encapsulation of the JNI Invocation API. In most cases,
you will get an instance of this class by calling the class method <code>GetDefault</code>.<br></li>

<li><code>TJavaParams</code> is an encapsulation of the list of parameters passed to a
Java method.<br></li>

<li><code>TJavaObject</code> is an encapsulation of a Java object.<br></li>

<li><code>TJavaClass</code> is an encapsulation of a Java class.<br></li>

<li><code>TJavaMethod</code> is an encapsulation of a Java method.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Use of the above classes is demonstrated in the various .dpr and .java
files that are included.</p>

<a name="Use"><h2>Notes on Use of the JNI wrapper methods:</h2></a>
  
  <p>Usage should be fairly intuitive, particularly from study of the
included examples.</p>

<p>In this version, there is a pretty sophisticated wrapper around the invocation
API. Typically, you instantiate a <code>TJavaRuntime</code> instance by calling the static
method <code>GetDefault</code>, which will look for a Java runtime on your system. By default,
it starts off looking for a Sun Java 6 or 7 or 8 JVM, and failing that, looks for a Sun 1.1 VM,
and if it can't find that, looks for the MS VM. (Note that the latter will only
work with the most recent JVM from Microsoft, the one that supports JNI.) You can
give it hints by calling the methods 
<code>SetPrefersMS</code> and <code>SetJava11</code> before calling
<code>GetDefault</code>. If you do that, you change the 
order in which the method searches.</p>

<p>You can also specify directly which VM you want to instantiate by calling:</p>

<p><code>TJavaRuntime.Create(&lt;choice&gt;)</code> where the choice can be one of:</p>

<center><code>SunJava11, SunJava2, or MSJava.</code></center>

<p>This method will raise an exception if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have already instantiated a JavaRuntime instance (you can only create one.)
<br><br></li>
<li>
The JVM you specified cannot be found on the system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The various run-time JVM options can be set via the properties 
<code>MaxHeapSize, MinHeapSize, Verbose</code>, etc.  of the class 
<code>TJavaRuntime</code>.  Note that these properties are effectively 
read-only after the VM is actually instantiated.</p> 

<h2>Notes on calling Delphi or FreePascal methods from Java:</h2>

<p>An example is provided of calling a Delphi or FreePascal DLL from Java. Note that in
order to use the JNI wrapper methods, you must first call:</p>

<center><code>TJavaVM.setThreadPenv(penv);</code></center>

<p>at the top of your native method.</p>

<p>The other big gotcha in terms of calling a native Delphi or FreePascal DLL from Java involves threading issues. 
Delphi or FreePascal variables that are to be used in multiple threads should be declared in a
<code>threadvar</code> section. Java objects wrappers that are to be used from multiple 
threads should be promoted to global references. This amounts to setting:</p>
 
 <center><code>JavaObject.Global := true;</code></center>
 
<p> with a <code>TJavaObject</code> (or <code>TJavaClass</code>) instance.</p>

<h2>Direct Use of JNI.pas:</h2>

<p>I anticipate that most people will prefer to call Java methods using
the wrapper classes in JNIWrapper.pas and JavaRuntime.pas. However, not all of
the JNI functionality is currently wrapped, so you may have to use JNI.pas directly.
If you do that, the source in JNIWrapper.pas provides a fairly involved model of
how to do so. Note that there is significant redundancy in the function pointers
which are provided by the JNI. Most calls have three forms of parameter
list that you can use, <code>CallXXXMethod(), CallXXXMethodV()</code>, and <code>CallXXXMethodA()</code>.
The first form uses a C-style variable length parameter list. As far as I know,
this has no Object Pascal equivalent. I have mostly opted to use the CallXXXMethodV calls,
which basically work by passing a totally raw pointer to the list of arguments.</p>

<p> That is indeed about as ugly as it gets. However, the <code>TJavaParams</code> wrapper
class is designed to shelter you from this ugliness. This class (in
conjunction with <code>TJavaMethod</code>) also protects you from having to supply
the Java method signature to obtain a reference to a Java method.</p>
